	<h1>About ML Bazaar</h1>
	<h2>What is Machine learning bazaar ?</h2>
	<p>MIT Data to AI Lab has created a number of open source ML libraries. These libraries have:  primitives, templates, pipelines, datasets, tuners, acquisition functions, selectors and automl components - a bazaar of sorts that incorporates decades of work in machine learning.</p>

	<h2>What is this website showing?</h2>
	<p>We are presenting the best so far end-to-end machine learning solutions generated by our automated system for about 453 datasets and the corresponding ML tasks.</p>

	<h2>How many tasks have you covered?</h2>
	<p>We cover 18 different machine learning tasks ranging from simple single table classification, to image regression to vertex nomination.</p>
