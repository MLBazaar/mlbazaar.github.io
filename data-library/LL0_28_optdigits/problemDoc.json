Relevant Information:\n \tWe used preprocessing programs made available by NIST to extract\n \tnormalized bitmaps of handwritten digits from a preprinted form. From\n \ta total of 43 people, 30 contributed to the training set and different\n \t13 to the test set. 32x32 bitmaps are divided into nonoverlapping \n \tblocks of 4x4 and the number of on pixels are counted in each block.\n \tThis generates an input matrix of 8x8 where each element is an \n \tinteger in the range 0..16. This reduces dimensionality and gives \n \tinvariance to small distortions.\n \n \tFor info on NIST preprocessing routines, see \n \tM. D. Garris, J. L. Blue, G. T. Candela, D. L. Dimmick, J.

The test set was used for \n \twriter-independent testing and is the actual quality measure.\n \n 6. Number of Attributes\n \t64 input+1 class attribute\n \n 7. For Each Attribute:\n \tAll input attributes are integers in the range 0..16.\n \tThe last attribute is the class code 0..9\n \n 8. Missing Attribute Values\n \tNone\n \n 9.
