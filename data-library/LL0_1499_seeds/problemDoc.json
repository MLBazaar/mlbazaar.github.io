High quality visualization of the internal kernel structure was detected using a soft X-ray technique. It is non-destructive and considerably cheaper than other more sophisticated imaging techniques like scanning microscopy or laser technology. The images were recorded on 13x18 cm X-ray KODAK plates. Studies were conducted using combine harvested wheat grain originating from experimental fields, explored at the Institute of Agrophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Lublin. The data set can be used for the tasks of classification and cluster analysis.\n\n* Attribute Information:\n\nTo construct the data, seven geometric parameters of wheat kernels were measured: \n1. area A, \n2. perimeter P, \n3. compactness C = 4*pi*A/P^2, \n4. length of kernel, \n5. width of kernel, \n6. asymmetry coefficient \n7. length of kernel groove. \nAll of these parameters were real-valued continuous.\n\n\n* Relevant Papers:\n\nM.
