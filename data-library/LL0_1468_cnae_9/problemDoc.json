The original texts were preprocessed to obtain the current data set: initially, it was kept only letters and then it was removed prepositions of the texts. Next, the words were transformed to their canonical form. Finally, \neach document was represented as a vector, where the weight of each word is its frequency in the document. \nThis data set is highly sparse (99.22% of the matrix is filled with zeros).\n\n### Attribute Information\n\nIn the dataset there are 857 attributes, 1 attributes with the class of instance and 856 with word frequency:\n ```\n1. category: range 1 - 9 (integer)   \n2. 857. word frequency: (integer)\n```\n\n### Relevant Papers\n\nPatrick Marques Ciarelli, Elias Oliveira, 'Agglomeration and Elimination of Terms for Dimensionality Reduction', \nNinth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications, pp.547-552, 2009 \n\nPatrick Marques Ciarelli, Elias Oliveira, Evandro O.
