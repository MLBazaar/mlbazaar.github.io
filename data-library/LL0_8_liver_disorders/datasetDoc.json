        "description": "**Author**: BUPA Medical Research Ltd. Donor: Richard S. Forsyth   \n**Source**: [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Liver+Disorders) - 5/15/1990  \n**Please cite**: \n\n**BUPA liver disorders**\n \nThe first 5 variables are all blood tests which are thought to be sensitive to liver disorders that might arise from excessive alcohol consumption.  Each line in the dataset constitutes the record of a single male individual. \n\n**Important note:** The 7th field (selector) has been widely misinterpreted in the past as a dependent variable representing presence or absence of a liver disorder. This is incorrect [1]. The 7th field was created by BUPA researchers as a train/test selector. It is not suitable as a dependent variable for classification. The dataset does not contain any variable representing presence or absence of a liver disorder. Researchers who wish to use this dataset as a classification benchmark should follow the method used in experiments by the donor (Forsyth & Rada, 1986, Machine learning: applications in expert systems and information retrieval) and others (e.g. Turney, 1995, Cost-sensitive classification: Empirical evaluation of a hybrid genetic decision tree induction algorithm), who used the 6th field (drinks), after dichotomising, as a dependent variable for classification. Because of widespread misinterpretation in the past, researchers should take care to state their method clearly.\n \n**Attribute information**  \n    1. mcv mean corpuscular volume  \n    2. alkphos alkaline phosphotase  \n    3. sgpt alanine aminotransferase  \n    4. sgot  aspartate aminotransferase  \n    5. gammagt gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase  \n    6. drinks number of half-pint equivalents of alcoholic beverages drunk per day  \n    7. selector field created by the BUPA researchers to split the data into train/test sets  \n\n[1] McDermott & Forsyth 2016, Diagnosing a disorder in a classification benchmark, Pattern Recognition Letters, Volume 73.
