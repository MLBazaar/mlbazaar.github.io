The average level and variance of strike volume varies across countries. The data distribution also features a long right tail and several large outliers. \n\nThe 7 data fields include the following variables:  \n>\n(1) country code;  \n(2) year;  \n(3) strike volume;  \n(4) unemployment;  \n(5) inflation;  \n(6) parliamentary representation of social democratic and labor parties  \n(7) a time-invariant measure of union centralization.\n\nThese data were analyzed in the forthcoming paper by Bruce Western, \"Vague Theory and Model Uncertainty in Macrosociology,\" which is to appear in Sociological Methodology.
