Each species was represented by 11 to 60 mass spectra obtained from 7 to 20 bacterial strains, constituting altogether a dataset of 571 spectra obtained from 213 strains. The spectra were obtained according to the standard culture-based workflow used in clinical routine in which the microorganism was first grown on an agar plate for 24 to 48 hours before a portion of the colony was picked, spotted on a MALDI slide and a mass spectrum was acquired. \n\nb) Based on this reference panel, a dedicated in vitro mock-up mixture dataset was constituted. For that purpose we considered 10 pairs of species of various taxonomic proximity:\n* 4 mixtures, labeled A, B, C and D, involved species that belong to the same genus,  \n* 2 mixtures, labeled E and F, involved species that belong to distinct genera, but to the same Gram type,  \n* 4 mixtures, labeled G, H, I and J, involved species that belong to distinct Gram types.  \nEach mixture was represented by 2 pairs of strains, which were mixed according to the following 9 concentration ratios : 1:0, 10:1, 5:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, 0:1. Two replicate spectra were acquired for each concentration ratio and each couple of strains, leading altogether to a dataset of 360 spectra, among which 80 are actually pure sample spectra.\n\n### Relevant Papers\n\nMah\u00e9 et al.
