The data was collected from the\n    four following locations:\n \n      1. Cleveland Clinic Foundation (cleveland.data)\n      2. Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, Budapest (hungarian.data)\n      3. V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach, CA (long-beach-va.data)\n      4. University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland (switzerland.data)\n \n    Each database has the same instance format.  While the databases have 76\n    raw attributes, only 14 of them are actually used.  Thus I've taken the\n    liberty of making 2 copies of each database: one with all the attributes\n    and 1 with the 14 attributes actually used in past experiments.\n \n    The authors of the databases have requested:\n \n       ...that any publications resulting from the use of the data include the \n       names of the principal investigator responsible for the data collection\n       at each institution.  They would be:\n \n        1. Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. Budapest: Andras Janosi, M.D.\n        2. University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland: William Steinbrunn, M.D.\n        3.

Relevant Information:\n      This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments\n      refer to using a subset of 14 of them.  In particular, the Cleveland\n      database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to \n      this date.  The \"goal\" field refers to the presence of heart disease\n      in the patient.  It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.\n      Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply\n      attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value\n      0).  \n    \n      The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently \n      removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.\n \n      One file has been \"processed\", that one containing the Cleveland \n      database.  All four unprocessed files also exist in this directory.\n     \n 5.
