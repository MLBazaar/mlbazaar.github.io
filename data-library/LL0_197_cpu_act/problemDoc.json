        "problemDescription": "**Author**:   \n**Source**: Unknown -   \n**Please cite**:   \n\nThe Computer Activity databases are a collection of computer systems\n activity measures. The data was collected from a Sun Sparcstation\n 20/712 with 128 Mbytes of memory running in a multi-user university\n department. Users would typically be doing a large variety of tasks\n ranging from accessing the internet, editing files or running very\n cpu-bound programs.  The data was collected continuously on two\n separate occasions. On both occassions, system activity was gathered\n every 5 seconds. The final dataset is taken from both occasions with\n equal numbers of observations coming from each collection epoch.\n \n System measures used:\n 1. lread - Reads (transfers per second ) between system memory and user memory.\n 2. lwrite - writes (transfers per second) between system memory and user memory.\n 3. scall - Number of system calls of all types per second.\n 4. sread - Number of system read calls per second.\n 5. swrite - Number of system write calls per second . \n 6. fork - Number of system fork calls per second. \n 7. exec - Number of system exec calls per second. \n 8. rchar - Number of characters transferred per second by system read calls.\n 9. wchar - Number of characters transfreed per second by system write calls. \n 10. pgout - Number of page out requests per second.\n 11. ppgout - Number of pages, paged out per second. \n 12. pgfree - Number of pages per second placed on the free list. \n 13. pgscan - Number of pages checked if they can be freed per second.\n 14. atch - Number of page attaches (satisfying a page fault by reclaiming a page in memory) per second.\n 15. pgin - Number of page-in requests per second.\n 16. ppgin - Number of pages paged in per second.\n 17. pflt - Number of page faults caused by protection errors (copy-on-writes). \n 18. vflt - Number of page faults caused by address translation. \n 19. runqsz - Process run queue size.\n 20. freemem - Number of memory pages available to user processes.\n 21. freeswap - Number of disk blocks available for page swapping. \n 22. usr - Portion of time (%) that cpus run in user mode.\n 23. sys - Portion of time (%) that cpus run in system mode.\n 24. wio - Portion of time (%) that cpus are idle waiting for block IO.\n 25. idle - Portion of time (%) that cpus are otherwise idle.\n \n The two different regression tasks obtained from these databases are:\n \n CompAct \n Predict usr, the portion of time that cpus run in user mode from all attributes 1-21.\n \n CompAct(s) \n Predict usr using a restricted number (excluding the paging information (10-18)\n \n Source: collection of regression datasets by Luis Torgo (ltorgo@ncc.up.pt) at\n http://www.ncc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/DataSets.html\n Original source: DELVE repository of data. \n Characteristics: 8192 cases, 22 continuous attributes",
