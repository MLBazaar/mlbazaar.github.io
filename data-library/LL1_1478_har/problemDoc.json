Bruges, Belgium 24-26 April 2013.   \n\n### Description\n\nHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. This dataset version contains all the training and testing examples provided in the original data repository.\n\n### Source\n\nJorge L.

Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. \n\nThe sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low-frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.\n\n\n### Attribute Information\n\nFor each record in the dataset it is provided: \n* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. \n* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. \n* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. \n* It's activity label. \n\n### Relevant Papers\n\nDavide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L.
