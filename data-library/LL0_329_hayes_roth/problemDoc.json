On OpenML this train-test split can be found as one of the possible tasks.\n\nSource Information: \n(a) Creators: Barbara and Frederick Hayes-Roth \n(b) Donor: David W. Aha (aha@ics.uci.edu) (714) 856-8779  \n(c) Date: March, 1989  \n\nAttribute Information: \n-- 1. name: distinct for each instance and represented numerically \n-- 2. hobby: nominal values ranging between 1 and 3 \n-- 3. age: nominal values ranging between 1 and 4 \n-- 4. educational level: nominal values ranging between 1 and 4 \n-- 5. marital status: nominal values ranging between 1 and 4 \n-- 6. class: nominal value between 1 and 3  \n\nDetailed description of the experiment: \n1. 3 categories (1, 2, and neither -- which I call 3) \n-- some of the instances could be classified in either class 1 or 2, and they have been evenly distributed between the two classes \n2. 5 Attributes \n-- A. name (a randomly-generated number between 1 and 132) \n-- B. hobby (a randomly-generated number between 1 and 3) \n-- C. age (a number between 1 and 4) \n-- D. education level (a number between 1 and 4) \n-- E. marital status (a number between 1 and 4) \n3. Classification:  \n-- only attributes C-E are diagnostic; values for A and B are ignored \n-- Class Neither: if a 4 occurs for any attribute C-E \n-- Class 1: Otherwise, if (# of 1's)>(# of 2's) for attributes C-E \n-- Class 2: Otherwise, if (# of 2's)>(# of 1's) for attributes C-E \n-- Either 1 or 2: Otherwise, if (# of 2's)=(# of 1's) for attributes C-E \n4.
