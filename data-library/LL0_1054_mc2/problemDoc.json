The specific type of software is unknown. Data comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code.  These features were defined in the 70s in an attempt to objectively characterize code features that are associated with software quality.\n\n### Relevant papers  \n\n- Shepperd, M. and Qinbao Song and Zhongbin Sun and Mair, C.
