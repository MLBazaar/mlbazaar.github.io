        "problemDescription": "**Author**: Marko Bohanec, Blaz Zupan  \n**Source**: [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/car+evaluation) - 1997   \n**Please cite**: [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/citation_policy.html)  \n\n**Car Evaluation Database**\nThis database was derived from a simple hierarchical decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX (M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.).\n\nThe model evaluates cars according to the following concept structure:\n \n    CAR                      car acceptability\n    . PRICE                  overall price\n    . . buying               buying price\n    . . maint                price of the maintenance\n    . TECH                   technical characteristics\n    . . COMFORT              comfort\n    . . . doors              number of doors\n    . . . persons            capacity in terms of persons to carry\n    . . . lug_boot           the size of luggage boot\n    . . safety               estimated safety of the car\n \nInput attributes are printed in lowercase. Besides the target concept (CAR), the model includes three intermediate concepts: PRICE, TECH, COMFORT. Every concept is in the original model related to its lower level descendants by a set of examples (for\nthese examples sets see http://www-ai.ijs.si/BlazZupan/car.html).\n \nThe Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety. Because of known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.\n\n### Relevant papers:  \nM.
