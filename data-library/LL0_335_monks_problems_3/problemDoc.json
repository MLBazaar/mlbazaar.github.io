After listening more than one week to a wide variety of learning algorithms, they felt rather confused: Which algorithm would be optimal? And which one to avoid? As a consequence of this dilemma, they created a simple task on which all learning algorithms ought to be compared: the three MONK's problems.\n\nThe target concept associated with the 3rd Monk's problem is the binary outcome of the logical formula:  \nMONK-3: (a5 = 3 and a4 = 1) or (a5 /= 4 and a2 /= 3)  \nIn addition, 5% class noise was added to the training set\n\nIn this dataset, the original train and test sets were merged to allow other sampling procedures. However, the original train-test splits can be found as one of the OpenML tasks. \n\n### Attribute information: \n* attr1: 1, 2, 3 \n* attr2: 1, 2, 3 \n* attr3: 1, 2 \n* attr4: 1, 2, 3 \n* attr5: 1, 2, 3, 4 \n* attr6: 1, 2 \n\n### Relevant papers  \nThe MONK's Problems - A Performance Comparison of Different Learning Algorithms, by S.B.
