        "problemDescription": "**Author**: Dr. William H. Wolberg, University of Wisconsin  \n**Source**: [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(original)), [University of Wisconsin](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~olvi/uwmp/cancer.html) - 1995  \n**Please cite**: See below, plus [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/citation_policy.html)  \n\n**Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set.** Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The target feature records the prognosis (malignant or benign). [Original data available here](ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/math-prog/cpo-dataset/machine-learn/cancer/)  \n\nCurrent dataset was adapted to ARFF format from the UCI version. Sample code ID's were removed.  \n\n! Note that there is also a related Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnosis) Data Set with a different set of features, better known as [wdbc](https://www.openml.org/d/1510).\n\n### Relevant Papers  \n\nW.N.
