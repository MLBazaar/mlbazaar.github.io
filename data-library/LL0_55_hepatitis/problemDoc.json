HISTOLOGY: no, yes\n \n     The BILIRUBIN attribute appears to be continuously-valued.  I checked\n     this with the donater, Bojan Cestnik, who replied:\n \n       About the hepatitis database and BILIRUBIN problem I would like to say\n       the following: BILIRUBIN is continuous attribute (= the number of it's\n       \"values\" in the ASDOHEPA.DAT file is negative!!!); \"values\" are quoted\n       because when speaking about the continuous attribute there is no such \n       thing as all possible values. However, they represent so called\n       \"boundary\" values; according to these \"boundary\" values the attribute\n       can be discretized. At the same time, because of the continious\n       attribute, one can perform some other test since the continuous\n       information is preserved. I hope that these lines have at least roughly \n       answered your question. \n \n 8.
