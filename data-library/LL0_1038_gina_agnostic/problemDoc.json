        "problemDescription": "**Author**:   \n**Source**: Unknown - Date unknown  \n**Please cite**:   \n\nDatasets from the Agnostic Learning vs. Prior Knowledge Challenge (http://www.agnostic.inf.ethz.ch)\n\nDataset from: http://www.agnostic.inf.ethz.ch/datasets.php\n\n\nModified by TunedIT (converted to ARFF format)\n\n\nGINA is digit recognition database\n\nThe task of GINA is handwritten digit recognition. For the \"agnostic learning track\" we chose the problem of separating two-digit odd numbers from two-digit even numbers. Only the unit digit is informative for that task, therefore at least 1/2 of the features are distracters. Additionally, the pixels that are almost always blank were removed and the pixel order was randomized to hide the feature identity.  This is a two class classification problem with sparse continuous input variables, in which each class is composed of several clusters. It is a problem with heterogeneous classes.\n\nData type: non-sparse\nNumber of features: 970\nNumber of examples and check-sums:\nPos_ex\tNeg_ex\tTot_ex\tCheck_sum\nTrain\t 1550\t 1603\t 3153\t164947945.00\nValid\t  155\t  160\t  315\t16688946.00\n\n\nThis dataset contains samples from both training and validation datasets.",
