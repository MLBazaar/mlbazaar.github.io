Relevant Information:\n    This dataset is a subset of the 1987 National Indonesia Contraceptive\n    Prevalence Survey. The samples are married women who were either not \n    pregnant or do not know if they were at the time of interview. The \n    problem is to predict the current contraceptive method choice \n    (no use, long-term methods, or short-term methods) of a woman based \n    on her demographic and socio-economic characteristics.\n \n 5.
